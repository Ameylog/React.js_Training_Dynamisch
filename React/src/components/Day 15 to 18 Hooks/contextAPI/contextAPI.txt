ğŸ‘‰ vitual DOM is store in heap memory in the form of object.

ğŸ‘‰ When you use state in a functional component (as done in the Context Provider), React manages the state using JavaScript objects and closures. These objects and closures are stored in memory, which is part of the browser's runtime environment.
